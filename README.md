Simple languages. Experiments with many lambdas.

Implementations in python of the lambdas in TAPL (Types and Programming Languages).

Initial intention was to learn System F which is the core of the Core Language of Haskell.

And I found following contents interesting, and will dig into them.

* Recursive Function / Types, the fix.
* Annotation on Type abstractions, like bounds?

Also implemented a SLR parser, instantiated in-place without code generation when fed a grammar. I think it's much convenient for testing purpose. And the implementation is supposed to be buggy ðŸ˜‰.
